# Context Graph Engine

> Turn any docs into a structured **context graph** that AI agents read from before doing work — and contribute their learnings back to, so the graph gets smarter every time it's used.

Dumping docs into a vector store gives you a bag of chunks. It doesn't give you *structure* an agent can reason over, and there's no clean way for an agent to send back what it learned mid-task. The Context Graph Engine fixes both:

- **Ingest** any docs → a graph of **entities** (concepts, systems, people, APIs…) connected by typed **relationships**, grounded in the original source passages.
- **Read** the graph before a task → get a compact, structured context bundle (entities + relationships + supporting sources), ready to drop into a prompt.
- **Contribute** learnings back → new facts are deduplicated and merged into existing knowledge; repeated observations **reinforce** confidence. The graph compounds over time.

Access it four ways: a **web UI** (your team's knowledge as a living, citable graph — see below), a **library**, a **CLI**, or an **MCP server** that any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, …) can plug into.

> **Benchmark:** on a real 344-file repo, giving the agent the graph up front cut tool calls **31%**, cost **23%**, and latency **17%** vs. exploring cold — same model, same tools, only difference is the graph bundle.

## Install

**One line, runs locally, no API keys required:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NanoNets/context-graph-engine/main/install.sh | sh
```

This puts `context-graph`, `context-graph-mcp`, and `context-graph-web` on your PATH. Requires git and Node ≥ 20.

Or straight from GitHub with npm (also works as a library / dev dependency):

```bash
npm install -g github:NanoNets/context-graph-engine
```

## Try it in 60 seconds — the web UI

```bash
context-graph-web
# → http://localhost:4680
```

Open the page, drop a folder of `.pdf` / `.md` / `.txt` files on the **“Add documents”** dropzone, and watch it become a knowledge graph. Then ask questions: answers come back with numbered citations, and every fact wears a **provenance receipt** — how many times it's been observed, how confident the graph is, and which sources say so. Use **“Add a fact”** to record something the docs don't capture, and watch the graph reinforce in real time.

Everything runs on your machine (the server binds to localhost only). Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to upgrade to LLM-written answers and cloud extraction; without it, retrieval and the graph stay fully local.

Running it for your whole team? One `docker compose up` gives everyone the same graph at one URL — see [Team sharing](#team-sharing).

### Or run everything at once — `context-graph serve`

```bash
context-graph serve
# → web UI      http://localhost:4680
#   MCP (HTTP)  http://localhost:4680/mcp
```

One process runs the web UI, the MCP server (over HTTP), and the folder watcher on a single port over **one shared engine** — the supported way to run the whole thing at once, with no separate `watch` daemon to babysit. Open the UI, click **Connect a folder**, tick **Keep watching**, and that folder is ingested and watched live; it's remembered, so the next `serve` resumes it. Prefer the command line? Pass folders directly: `context-graph serve ./sample-docs`.

### Runs locally by default — keys are optional

Out of the box the engine needs **no accounts and no cloud calls**:

- **Embeddings** run **in-process** via a small ONNX model (transformers.js) — downloaded and cached on first use.
- **Extraction** uses a local **[Ollama](https://ollama.com)** model. Install Ollama and pull one:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3.2
  ```

Want higher-quality cloud models instead? Set a key and the engine uses it **automatically** (local remains the fallback):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...   # cloud extraction via OpenRouter
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # cloud embeddings (optional; local otherwise)
```

Force local even when keys are present with `CONTEXT_GRAPH_LOCAL=1`.

---

## Quickstart (library)

```ts
import { ContextGraphEngine } from "context-graph-engine";

const engine = new ContextGraphEngine(); // persists to ./.context-graph/graph.db

// 1. Ingest docs — builds the graph.
await engine.ingest(myMarkdownDocs, { title: "Onboarding" });
await engine.ingestFile("./docs/architecture.md");

// 2. Read before doing work.
const ctx = await engine.read("how does authentication work?");
console.log(ctx.prompt);   // inject this string into your agent
console.log(ctx.nodes);    // structured entities
console.log(ctx.edges);    // structured relationships

// 3. Contribute what an agent learned.
await engine.contribute(
  "The auth service rotates tokens every 15 minutes.",
  { agentId: "code-reviewer" },
);
```

Run the full working demo (set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or run a local Ollama):

```bash
npm run example
```

---

## CLI

```bash
# Ingest documents (Markdown, text, and PDFs — PDFs are parsed automatically)
context-graph ingest ./docs/*.md ./handbook.pdf
context-graph ingest-dir ./docs           # a whole folder, recursively
echo "some notes" | context-graph ingest-text --title "Notes"

# Keep the graph evolving as a folder changes (see "Auto-watch")
context-graph watch ./docs        # register + watch; re-run with no args to resume
context-graph ingest-dir ./docs --watch   # ingest now, register for watching
context-graph watch-status        # list registered folders
context-graph unwatch ./docs

# Ingest a code repository — as summaries, not raw code (see "Code repositories")
context-graph repo .

# Ingest GitHub pull requests (title, description, review discussion) via the gh CLI
context-graph ingest-prs --state merged --limit 50

# Wire the graph into Claude Code (see "Claude Code hooks")
context-graph install-hooks

# Visualize the graph (interactive HTML; also --format json|mermaid)
context-graph export --out graph.html && open graph.html

# Read the graph
context-graph query "how does billing retry failed charges?"
context-graph query "billing" --json          # full structured bundle

# Contribute a learning
context-graph contribute "Dunning worker retries 3x then marks past_due" --agent me

# Inspect
context-graph stats

# Point at a specific graph file
context-graph --db ./team-graph.db query "auth"

# Team sharing — git mode (see "Team sharing" below)
context-graph sync            # pull teammates' graph.jsonl, re-merge, write it back
context-graph push            # write the graph to a committable graph.jsonl
context-graph pull            # import + re-merge a teammate's graph.jsonl
```

---

## MCP server

Expose the graph to any MCP client so agents can `context_read` and `context_contribute` directly — the same "shared skill / durable memory" model as tools like ByteRover.

Add to your Claude Code / MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-graph": {
      "command": "context-graph-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CONTEXT_GRAPH_DB": "/absolute/path/to/team-graph.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or, if you're running `context-graph serve`, point any MCP client at its HTTP endpoint instead of spawning a process:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-graph": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:4680/mcp" }
  }
}
```

When the server is exposed beyond localhost, add `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <access-token>" }` — the same token the web UI prints.

The API-key env vars are optional — add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (and optionally `OPENAI_API_KEY` for embeddings) only if you want cloud models instead of the local defaults.

Tools exposed:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `context_read` | Read relevant context for a query before working |
| `context_contribute` | Write a learning back into the shared graph |
| `context_ingest` | Ingest a document (raw text) into the graph |
| `context_ingest_file` | Ingest files from disk, including **PDFs** (parsed automatically) |
| `context_ingest_dir` | Ingest a whole **directory** of docs (PDF/MD/TXT by default; pass `extensions` to widen), recursively |
| `context_ingest_repo` | Ingest a **code repository** as per-file prose summaries (never raw code); incremental across runs |
| `context_watch_dir` | Connect a folder for **auto-watching**: ingest it now and re-ingest files as they change (see "Auto-watch") |
| `context_unwatch_dir` | Disconnect a watched folder (its knowledge stays in the graph) |
| `context_watch_status` | List connected folders and the ingest queue |
| `context_export` | Write the graph to an interactive **HTML** visualization |
| `context_sync` | Team sharing (git mode): import + re-merge the shared `graph.jsonl`, then write it back |
| `context_stats` | Report how much the graph currently holds |

A natural agent workflow: **read context → do the task → contribute what you learned.**

## Code repositories

`context-graph repo <dir>` (or the `context_ingest_repo` MCP tool) ingests a codebase — but deliberately **never feeds raw source code to the entity extractor**. Running LLM extraction over thousands of code chunks is the most expensive way to compute what `grep` and tree-sitter give agents for free, and it fills the graph with noisy, duplicated symbol entities. (Every serious code-context system — aider, Cursor, Sourcegraph, Claude Code — derives code *structure* statically, and uses LLMs only for prose.)

Instead, repo ingestion:

1. Walks the repo for code files (`.ts`, `.py`, `.go`, … — `node_modules`/`dist`/etc. and files over 1 MB are skipped).
2. Writes **one LLM prose summary per file**: purpose, key exports, dependencies, design decisions.
3. Groups summaries into one document per top-level directory and ingests those through the normal pipeline — so the graph gains *module-level* entities ("the chunker is paragraph-aware", "the CLI requires the GitHub CLI for PR ingestion") with provenance, not ten thousand function names.

It is **incremental**: summaries are cached by content hash in `repo-summaries.json` next to the db, so re-running after edits only re-summarizes changed files, and a changed file's module document *replaces* its predecessor rather than piling up stale duplicates. An unchanged repo re-ingests with **zero** LLM calls.

The same replace-on-change behavior now applies to every file ingest: re-ingesting a modified doc replaces the old version instead of leaving both in the graph.

For a ~30-file repo expect ~30 small summary calls on first run; the graph stays module-scale (a handful of documents) rather than chunk-soup-scale. Agents should still read raw code with their own tools — the graph holds what code can't say: intent, decisions, and gotchas.

## Auto-watch — an evolving graph

Connect a folder once and the graph tracks it: files you add or edit are re-ingested automatically, so the graph evolves with your notes instead of freezing at ingest time.

```bash
context-graph watch ~/notes        # catch up on the folder, then watch it live
# … later, in a fresh shell — no args needed, registered folders resume:
context-graph watch
```

How it behaves:

- **Debounced and cheap.** Saves are coalesced (~1.5 s quiet time per file) and unchanged files are skipped by content hash, so a daemon restart over a big unchanged folder costs zero LLM calls. Edited files *replace* their old document rather than piling up copies.
- **Append-only.** Deleting a file never removes knowledge already learned from it — the graph is a memory, not a mirror. The deletion is logged and nothing else happens.
- **Same rules as `ingest-dir`.** Default extensions `.pdf .md .markdown .txt` (override with `--ext`), dot-dirs / `node_modules` / files over 1 MB are ignored.
- **Registered folders** live in `watched-dirs.json` next to the db (machine-local — it never rides the git-synced graph). `ingest-dir --watch` registers while ingesting; `watch-status` / `unwatch` manage the list.
- **One watcher per db.** Run a single `watch` daemon per graph; MCP sessions and the web UI can read concurrently while it runs.

Elsewhere: the `context_watch_dir` MCP tool connects a folder for the life of the agent session (set `CONTEXT_GRAPH_AUTOWATCH=1` on the MCP server to auto-resume registered folders), and `CONTEXT_GRAPH_WATCH=1` does the same for `context-graph-web` — the UI picks up growth live.

## Claude Code hooks

`context-graph install-hooks` wires the graph into Claude Code via `.claude/settings.json` (merges with what's already there):

- **SessionStart** — every new session begins with relevant graph context (conventions, decisions, gotchas) auto-injected, plus a reminder that `context_contribute` exists.
- **Stop** — when the agent finishes, it's nudged once to record any durable learnings from the session before ending. Pass `--no-stop` to skip this hook if you find the nudge too chatty.

Both hooks stay silent when there's no graph yet, so installing them in a fresh project is harmless. Combined with the MCP server this closes the loop: sessions **start** with team knowledge and **end** by adding to it.

## GitHub pull requests

PR descriptions and review threads are where decisions actually get written down. `context-graph ingest-prs` pulls them into the graph via the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (no extra auth needed if `gh` is logged in):

```bash
context-graph ingest-prs                      # merged PRs of the current repo (default 50)
context-graph ingest-prs -R owner/name -n 100 --state all
```

Each PR becomes one document (title, description, review discussion) with source `pr:owner/name#123`. Re-runs are cheap: unchanged PRs are skipped by hash, edited ones replace their old version.

---

## Team sharing

A solo graph is one SQLite file. To share one across a team, pick a mode. All three keep the local-first default intact (team sync is **opt-in**).

### The easy mode — one shared server (recommended)

This is how nearly every self-hosted team tool works (Vaultwarden, Outline, BookStack): one instance, one URL, everyone's browser. No sync to configure, contributions land in the same graph instantly, and there is exactly one copy of the truth.

```bash
docker compose up -d
cat ./data/share-link.txt           # the share link, with access token
```

The graph persists to `./data/graph.db`. Ingest documents two ways: click **Choose a folder…** in the UI to upload a folder straight from your computer (works for remote teammates), or drop files into `./docs` on the server and ingest the mounted `/docs` path. When exposed beyond localhost the API requires an access token. It's generated once, saved to `./data/share-link.txt` (and printed to `docker compose logs`), and **stays stable across restarts** so shared links keep working. Pin your own with `CONTEXT_GRAPH_WEB_TOKEN`.

No server to put it on? Run it on any machine and share it over [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) without opening a port to the internet:

```bash
context-graph-web &
tailscale serve localhost:4680      # private HTTPS URL, visible only to your tailnet
```

### Git mode — sync separate graphs, no server at all

Prefer no shared server? Each teammate keeps their own local graph and git moves the knowledge around. This relies on the graph's **conflict-free merge**: observations are a grow-only counter and free-text fields are last-writer-wins, so re-importing the same facts never double-counts and merge order never changes the result.

Commit the graph to your repo as a human-diffable file and let git move it around.

```bash
# You: capture the merged graph and commit it
context-graph sync
git add .context-graph/graph.jsonl && git commit -m "sync context graph" && git push

# A teammate: get the latest and converge their local graph
git pull
context-graph sync
```

`sync` imports the committed `.context-graph/graph.jsonl`, re-merges it into the local graph, and writes the merged result back. It's idempotent (safe to run repeatedly) and commutative (order-independent), so two teammates' additions always converge. The repo's `.gitignore` keeps the local SQLite replica private while tracking `graph.jsonl`. Best for teams already living in git who want no servers and offline-friendly sharing; the only friction is the occasional merge conflict on the file, resolved by re-running `sync`.

> Both modes assume one embedding model per graph (see the note under *How it works*). Imports across mismatched embedding dimensions keep the facts but drop the incompatible vectors, and warn you to re-ingest sources to re-embed.

---

## How the graph gets smarter over time

Every entity and relationship carries a `confidence` score and an `observations` count.

- **Dedup on write.** When new knowledge comes in, each entity is matched against existing nodes by exact name/alias **and** embedding similarity (cosine ≥ `mergeThreshold`). A match is *merged*, not duplicated.
- **Reinforcement.** Each observation is recorded under the id of the document/contribution that made it, so `observations` is a grow-only counter and `confidence` is *derived* from it (seen-often facts rise toward 1.0; one-offs stay low). Because the counter merges by taking the max per source, re-importing the same records is a no-op — reinforcement survives team sync without double-counting.
- **Provenance.** Every node/edge tracks which documents and agents contributed to it.
- **Grounding.** Source passages are kept as retrievable evidence and returned alongside the structured graph.

This is what makes contributions compound: the tenth agent to confirm a fact strengthens it rather than cluttering the graph.

---

## How it works

```
        ingest / contribute                         read
   ┌──────────────────────────┐            ┌────────────────────────┐
   │ text → chunk → embed      │            │ query → embed           │
   │      → extract (LLM)      │            │  → semantic match nodes │
   │      → MERGE (dedup +     │───────────▶│  → expand 1 hop (edges) │
   │        reinforce)         │  graph     │  → gather source chunks │
   └──────────────────────────┘  (SQLite)  │  → render context bundle│
                                            └────────────────────────┘
```

- **Storage** — SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) by default, or swap in your own `GraphStore`.
- **Extraction** — local **Ollama** (`llama3.2` by default) using structured JSON output; automatically upgrades to **OpenRouter** (`openai/gpt-4o-mini` by default, any tool-calling model) if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set.
- **Embeddings** — local **in-process** model (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim) by default; automatically upgrades to **OpenAI** (`text-embedding-3-small`) if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.
- **Retrieval** — semantic match over entities + one-hop graph expansion + supporting source passages.

> Note: embeddings from different models aren't comparable, so pick local **or** cloud for a given database and stick with it — don't switch providers mid-graph.

---

## Configuration

Everything is configurable via constructor options, environment variables, or defaults (in that order):

```ts
new ContextGraphEngine({
  dbPath: "./.context-graph/graph.db",          // CONTEXT_GRAPH_DB
  // Cloud (used automatically when set):
  openrouterApiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  openrouterModel: "openai/gpt-4o-mini",         // CONTEXT_GRAPH_OPENROUTER_MODEL
  openaiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,      // optional, embeddings only
  embeddingModel: "text-embedding-3-small",      // CONTEXT_GRAPH_EMBEDDING_MODEL
  // Local (the zero-key fallback):
  forceLocal: false,                             // CONTEXT_GRAPH_LOCAL=1 forces local
  localEmbeddingModel: "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",// CONTEXT_GRAPH_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL
  ollamaModel: "llama3.2",                       // CONTEXT_GRAPH_OLLAMA_MODEL
  ollamaBaseUrl: "http://localhost:11434",       // CONTEXT_GRAPH_OLLAMA_URL
  chunkSize: 1200,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
  mergeThreshold: 0.86,   // higher = stricter dedup
});
```

### Bring your own components

The engine depends only on small interfaces, so you can replace any piece:

```ts
import { ContextGraphEngine, type Embedder, type Extractor, type GraphStore, type Summarizer } from "context-graph-engine";

new ContextGraphEngine({
  store: myCustomStore,          // e.g. Postgres/pgvector
  embedder: myCustomEmbedder,    // any embedding model
  extractor: myCustomExtractor,  // any LLM, or a rules-based extractor
  summarizer: myCustomSummarizer // code-file summaries for ingestRepo
});
```

This is exactly how the test suite runs the whole pipeline offline with fake providers.

---

## API reference (essentials)

```ts
class ContextGraphEngine {
  ingest(text: string, opts?: { title?; source? }): Promise<IngestResult>;
  ingestFile(path: string, opts?): Promise<IngestResult>;   // .pdf parsed automatically
  ingestDir(dir: string, opts?): Promise<IngestResult[]>;   // recursive; PDF/MD/TXT
  ingestRepo(dir: string, opts?): Promise<RepoIngestResult>; // code → per-file summaries, incremental
  read(query: string, opts?: { maxNodes?; maxChunks?; expand? }): Promise<ContextBundle>;
  contribute(learning: string, opts?: { agentId?; source? }): Promise<ContributeResult>;
  exportGraph(): GraphExport;                               // -> toHtml / toMermaid
  stats(): GraphStats;
  close(): void;
}
```

A `ContextBundle` contains `{ query, nodes, edges, chunks, prompt }` — use `prompt` for a ready-made context block, or the structured arrays to build your own.
